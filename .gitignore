# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.

# Ignore subsequent changes to the dictionary SQLite file. Because git treats
# SQLite as a binary format, every change to this file stores a new copy of the
# file. To reduce churn, we package a copy of the dictionary that is sufficient
# for dev use, even if it's out of date. We also update the dictionary file each
# time bin/setup or rake dictionary:update is run, and automatically download
# the latest version when we start deployed dynos.
