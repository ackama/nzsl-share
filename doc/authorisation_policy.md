# Permissions list for NZSL Share

## Types of Users and their permissions:

### Browser

- A ‘general’ user with the most basic permissions. May or may not have an
  account. They can:

  - browse the site for signs that are publicly available
  - view content passively: e.g. read comments and see upvotes, but cannot make
    them
  - create an account. Once this is done, they can:
    - create private folders, and add signs to those folders
    - see their own folders
    - share a sign with other browsers via a link
    - share their folders with other browsers via a link
  - request to become an approved user
  - flag/report comments
  - upload a private sign

#### Nice to have:

    - Can invite other browsers to collaborate on a folder
    - Can see folders that they have collaboration access to -      their own, and ones that they are collaborators on

### Approved User

- A user with an account who has been ‘approved’ by an admin. Admin approve
  these users on the basis of a short set of demographic questions to determine
  whether they are members of the Deaf community and fluent NZSL users. They
  can:

* comment on signs (anonymously or not), using text or video
* delete and edit their own comments
* ‘agree’ with signs, and can undo this action
* ‘disagree’ with signs, and can undo this action
* upload new signs, privately: they can edit/delete these as they wish.
* add metadata about signs as part of the upload process, and see a list of
  existing tags / categories
* upload new signs, publicly: they have to request the sign to be made public.
  Admin will need to approve it. If they wish to edit/delete a sign once it has
  been made public, they have to request an admin’s permission.

### Validator

- An approved user who has been invited by an admin to become a validator. They
  can:

* view surveys they have been invited by admins to participate in
* accept/decline request to participate in survey
* respond to surveys sent to them by admins
* Permissions on editing survey answers TBD as this will depend on interaction
  with the chosen surveying tool

Nice to have:

- view a list of signs they have given feedback on

### Moderator

- An NZSL Share member appointed by an Admin. They can:

* access the following ‘admin’ areas:
  - Publication requests
  - Reported Comments
* see ‘edit/delete’ options on show pages for comments and signs when browsing
  the site
* approve/deny signs that are pending publication
* add notes about why they have approved/denied signs so other admins can see
  their feedback
* hide comments by any user
* view/resolve reported comments
* edit contributed signs, including metadata
* edit categories
* unpublish a sign once it has been published

### Admin

- An NZSL Share staff member. They can:

* access all ‘admin’ areas: Reported Comments, Publication requests, Users,
