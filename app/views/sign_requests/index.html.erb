      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        NZSL is growing and changing all the time. If you can’t find a sign, you can place a request
        here.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Check first – carry out a search. Try a few different related words – perhaps the sign
          is translated slightly differently.
        </li>

        <li>
          Request a sign – e.g. ‘how do you sign ....?’ ‘Is there a sign for ...?’
        </li>

        <li>
          If a sign exists, approved NZSL Share members will reply and upload the sign they have seen.
        </li>

        <li>
          Other approved members will now be able to comment and vote, so that you can see how widespread the sign is.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Remember that natural language development takes time. There may not be a sign for the
        concept yet – but keep checking! As more Deaf signers start to discuss a concept, signs will
        emerge.

        We are still developing the Request a Sign section. For now, you can place a request on our Facebook group:
        NZSL Share – requests. Warning: this link will take you out of the NZSL Share page.
