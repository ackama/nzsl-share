Hello <%= @resource.email %>,

Someone has invited you to join a team on NZSL Share.
To join the team and set up an NZSL Share account, you
can visit <%= accept_invitation_url(@resource, invitation_token: @token) %>.

Don't want to join NZSL Share? That's ok you don't have to do anything else.

Thank you,
